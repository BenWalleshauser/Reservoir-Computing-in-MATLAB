# Reservoir-Computing-Basics-in-MATLAB
Reservoir computing is a specific type of recurrent neural net that uses randomly generated input and middle weights, with output weights that are trained with a simple linear regression. 

The purpose of the attached files are to provide users with a basic/minimalistic reservoir computer (RC) to help get an understanding of the concept.
